A research-inspired Python prototype for **Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling and dynamic rescheduling** in Industry 4.0 environments. The project combines a Genetic Algorithm scheduler with a Random Forest classifier that decides when rescheduling may be worthwhile under processing-time variation.

> This repository is an educational and experimental implementation inspired by Li et al. (2019), *Integration of Machine Learning and Optimization Techniques for Flexible Job-Shop Rescheduling in Industry 4.0*. It is not a line-by-line reproduction of the paper.

## Overview

The implementation models jobs as precedence-constrained operation sequences. Each operation may be processed by multiple compatible machines, machines may require sequence-dependent configuration changes, and setup activities compete for a limited setup-worker resource.

The workflow is conceptually:

```text
FJSP instance
    |
    v
Genetic Algorithm scheduler
    |
    v
Baseline schedule
    |
    +--> Processing-time variation features
    |
    v
Random Forest rescheduling classifier
    |
    +--> Reschedule with GA when triggered
    |
    v
Compare against periodic policies (P-2 / P-4 / P-7)
```

## Features

- Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) representation
- Precedence-constrained job operations
- Alternative compatible machines per operation

## Installation

Python 3.10 or newer is recommended.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jorsacademy/fjsp-ml-rescheduling.git
cd fjsp-ml-rescheduling

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the experiment

```bash
python fjsp_ml_rescheduler.py
```

The default entry point:

1. creates a sample FJSP instance;
2. trains the Random Forest classifier;
3. runs ML-triggered rescheduling;
4. compares it with periodic P-2, P-4 and P-7 policies; and
5. reports rescheduling frequency and makespan improvement statistics.

The full default experiment is intentionally more computationally expensive than the CI smoke tests.

## Validation and tests

Run the local smoke-test suite with:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

You can also check Python syntax directly:

```bash
python -m py_compile fjsp_ml_rescheduler.py
```

GitHub Actions runs both checks automatically for pushes and pull requests targeting `main`, using Python 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12.

## Reproducible smoke-run example

A lightweight seeded run was executed with:

```text
random.seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
population_size = 30
generations = 10
```

Observed result:

```text
Makespan: 29.73
Scheduled operations: 12 / 12

Operations assigned per machine:
Machine 0: 2
Machine 1: 3
Machine 2: 2
Machine 3: 2
Machine 4: 2
Machine 5: 1
```

The complete example output is available in [`docs/example_output.txt`](docs/example_output.txt).

## Implementation notes and fixes

Compared with the initial draft, the current version:

- avoids mutating setup-worker availability while candidate machines are merely being evaluated;
- supports `num_workers > 1` using independent setup-worker availability clocks;
- validates compatible machines, required machine configurations and chromosome job IDs;
- prevents two-point crossover failures for very short chromosomes;
- guards against division by zero in rescheduling-benefit evaluation;
- detects one-class training datasets before Random Forest/AUC evaluation; and
- removes the inaccurate claim that Tabu Search is implemented.

## Research limitations

The current implementation should be treated as a **research prototype**, not as a faithful experimental reproduction of the source paper.

Most importantly, processing-time variation is included in the classifier feature vector, but the current training label is still derived by comparing GA-generated schedules on the same base instance. A stronger dynamic-rescheduling formulation should propagate disruptions into the optimization state itself, freeze completed/in-progress operations, update remaining processing times and reschedule only the unfinished portion of the system.

For publication-level experimentation, consider adding:

- established FJSP benchmark instances;
- explicit event-driven schedule-state propagation;
- machine breakdown and new-job-arrival disruptions;
- rolling-horizon or partial rescheduling;
- repeated seeded runs and confidence intervals;
- stronger optimization baselines;
- hyperparameter tuning;
- feature-importance and calibration analysis; and
- statistical significance testing between rescheduling policies.
